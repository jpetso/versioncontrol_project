Version Control / Project Node Integration -
Integrates nodes of any content type with version control systems
supported by the Version Control API.


SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
This module makes it possible for users with a VCS account to
associate Drupal nodes ("project nodes") with repository locations and
appoint co-maintainers for these projects, which enables commit access control
based on project maintainership.

Version Control / Project Node Integration depends on the
Version Control API module.

Some code in Version Control / Project Node Integration was taken from the
CVS integration module on drupal.org, its authors deserve a lot of credits
and may also hold copyright for parts of this module.

This module was originally created as part of Google Summer of Code 2007,
so Google deserves some credits for making this possible. Thanks also
